# React Todo App

This is a simple todo app built with React, Vite, and Sass. The app allows users to create, edit, mark as completed, delete and reorder todos using drag & drop functionality. All changes made by the user are automatically saved to local storage.

-   **Edit Todos**: Modify the content of existing todos.
-   **Mark as Completed**: Toggle the completion status of todos.
-   **Delete Todos**: Remove unwanted tasks from your todo list.
-   **Drag & Drop**: Easily reorder todos by dragging and dropping them into place.
-   **Local Storage**: All changes made by the user are automatically saved to local storage, ensuring that the todo list persists between sessions.

## Technologies Used

-   React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   Sass: CSS extension language that adds features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.

-   Vite: Fast and modern build tooling for web development.
